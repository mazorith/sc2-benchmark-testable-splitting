Using OpenCV with Gstreamer support to run the encoding/decoding pipeline
- You will need to run the script to install the dependencies and compile opencv from source (handled in script)
- Make sure to install the necessary plugins, the encoder and decoder are considered 'bad' plugins, and are not included by default
- make sure you are able to run the tutorials and run gst-launch-1.0 on the command line to build and run pipelines
